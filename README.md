## What is Textream?

Textream is a free, open-source macOS app that guides you through your script with three modes: **word tracking** (highlights each word as you say it), **classic** (constant-speed auto-scroll), and **voice-activated** (scrolls while you speak, pauses when you're silent). It displays your text in a sleek **Dynamic Island-style overlay** at the top of your screen, a **draggable floating window**, or **fullscreen on a Sidecar iPad** — visible only to you, invisible to your audience.

Paste your script, hit play, and start speaking. When you're done, the overlay closes automatically.

## Download

**[Download the latest .dmg from Releases](https://github.com/f/textream/releases/latest)**

Or install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install f/textream/textream
```

> Requires **macOS 15 Sequoia** or later. Works on Apple Silicon and Intel.

### First launch

Since Textream is distributed outside the Mac App Store, macOS may block it on first open. Run this once in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Textream.app
```

Then right-click the app → **Open**. After the first launch, macOS remembers your choice.

## Features

### Guidance Modes

- **Word Tracking** (default) — On-device speech recognition highlights words as you say them. No cloud, no latency, works offline. Supports dozens of languages.
- **Classic** — Auto-scrolls at a constant speed. No microphone needed. Adjust scroll speed with a slider.
- **Voice-Activated** — Scrolls while you speak, pauses when you're silent or muted. Perfect for natural pacing.
- **Mouse scroll to catch up** — In Classic and Voice-Activated modes, scroll with your mouse to jump ahead or back. The timer pauses while you scroll and resumes from the new position.

### Display

- **Dynamic Island overlay** — A notch-shaped overlay at the top of your screen, inspired by the MacBook Dynamic Island. Sits above all apps.
- **Floating window mode** — Switch from the pinned notch to a draggable floating window you can place anywhere on screen.
- **Glass effect** — Enable a translucent frosted glass background for the floating window with adjustable opacity.
- **External display / Sidecar** — Show a fullscreen teleprompter on an external display or Sidecar iPad. Includes a mirror mode for use with prompter mirror rigs.
- **Adjustable size** — Resize the overlay width and text height from Settings (⌘,) to fit your screen.

### Customization

- **Font family** — Choose from Sans, Serif, Mono, or a dyslexia-friendly OpenDyslexic font.
- **Font size** — Four size presets: XS, SM, LG, XL.
- **Highlight color** — Six color presets: white, yellow, green, blue, pink, orange.
- **Scroll speed** — Adjustable words-per-second for Classic and Voice-Activated modes (0.5–8 w/s).
- **Language selection** — Choose your preferred speech recognition language for Word Tracking mode.

### Other

- **Live waveform** — Visual voice activity indicator so you always know the mic is picking you up.
- **Tap to jump** — Tap any word in the overlay to jump the tracker to that position.
- **Pause & resume** — Go off-script, take a break, come back. The tracker picks up where you left off.
- **Completely private** — All processing happens on-device. No accounts, no tracking, no data leaves your Mac.
- **Open source** — MIT licensed. Contributions welcome.

## Who it's for

| Use case | How Textream helps |
|---|---|
| **Streamers** | Read sponsor segments, announcements, and talking points without looking away from the camera. |
| **Interviewers** | Keep your questions visible while maintaining natural eye contact with your guest. |
| **Presenters** | Deliver keynotes, demos, and talks with confidence. Never lose your place. |
| **Podcasters** | Follow show notes, ad reads, and topic outlines hands-free while recording. |

## How It Works

1. **Paste your script** — Drop your talking points, interview questions, or full script into the text editor.
2. **Hit play** — The Dynamic Island overlay slides down from the top of your screen.
3. **Start speaking** — Words highlight in real-time as you read. When you finish, the overlay closes automatically.

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- macOS 15+
- Xcode 16+
- Swift 5.0+

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/f/textream.git
cd textream/Textream
open Textream.xcodeproj
```

Build and run with ⌘R in Xcode.

### Project structure

```
Textream/
├── Textream.xcodeproj
├── Info.plist
└── Textream/
    ├── TextreamApp.swift              # App entry point, deep link handling
    ├── ContentView.swift              # Main text editor UI + About view
    ├── TextreamService.swift          # Service layer, URL scheme handling
    ├── SpeechRecognizer.swift         # On-device speech recognition engine
    ├── NotchOverlayController.swift   # Dynamic Island + floating overlay
    ├── ExternalDisplayController.swift # Sidecar / external display output
    ├── NotchSettings.swift            # User preferences and presets
    ├── SettingsView.swift             # Tabbed settings UI
    ├── MarqueeTextView.swift          # Word flow layout and highlighting
    └── Assets.xcassets/               # App icon and colors
```

## URL Scheme

Textream supports the `textream://` URL scheme for launching directly into the overlay:

```
textream://read?text=Hello%20world
```

It also registers as a macOS Service, so you can select text in any app and send it to Textream via the Services menu.
